FIG. 2 illustrates a frequency division multiplexer signal generation and transmission system capable of generating and transmitting OFDM signals. As illustrated in FIG. 2, information bits to be transmitted on various sub-carriers are first mapped to complex OFDM symbols B.sub.1, . . . , B.sub.N, e.g., one symbol per sub-carrier for each symbol period, by a digital symbol generator (DSG) 202. Each OFDM symbol B.sub.k (where 1&lt;k&lt;N) is then modulated to a corresponding sub-carrier f.sub.k using a corresponding sinusoidal signal generator 214, 214' of signal generator module 204, thereby generating an analog sinusoid signal for one symbol duration for each sub-carrier. The symbol duration is equal to the inverse of the spacing between two adjacent sub-carriers, plus the duration of a cyclic prefix portion when present. Each complex OFDM symbol to be transmitted is used to convey information bits to be communicated."

The signals (SS.sub.1-SS.sub.N) of the sub-carriers are power amplified individually. The amplification of individual sub-carrier signals is performed in parallel, e.g., by using different sub-carrier signal paths, each sub-carrier signal path including a single power amplification module 206, 206' and a corresponding fixed filter 218, 218'. Each of the fixed filters 218, 218' correspond to the particular subcarrier frequency of the subcarrier path and is used to reject high order harmonics relative to the frequency of the subcarrier to which the filter 218, 218' corresponds. In cases where the filters 218, 218' are implemented as bandpass filters, they will normally have a passband centered around the corresponding subcarrier frequency and a bandwidth corresponding to the distance between subcarrier frequencies. In such a case, if the subcarrier frequency spacing is .DELTA.f the filter 218 will normally be a fixed filter with a center frequency centered around f.sub.1 and a bandwidth of approximately .DELTA.f. Similarly, in such a case filter 218' corresponding to subcarrier N, will normally be a fixed filter with a center frequency centered around f.sub.N and a bandwidth of approximately .DELTA.f. Fixed filters are relatively inexpensive to implement while matching filter cutoff regions to particular subcarrier frequencies has the advantage of reducing noise and potential interference between subcarrier signals which are later combined exclude signals, e.g., high order harmonics or other signals."

In such an embodiment, frequency control module 318 selectively controls generator 320 so that subcarrier frequency fx.sub.1 will remain within the acceptable frequency passband corresponding to the range of fixed filter 1 322.

The method of adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 13, wherein when the communication device is linked to the first communication network and the second communication network, wherein:\nthe transmission power of signals sent to the second communication network is lowered by a factor accounting to specific absorption rate (SAR) limits.",
        "15. A system for adjusting communication parameters for networks communicating with a communication device, the system comprising:\na processor;\na memory module for storing instructions for execution on the processor; and\na monitoring module for providing instructions for execution on the processor to monitor for when the communication device is linked to a first communication network and a second communication network and then compare a strength of received signals from the second network against a threshold; and\nwhen the strength of the received signals is less than the threshold, initiate an adjustment of a network parameter of signals received from the second communication network by the communication device.",
        "16. The system for adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 15, wherein when the strength of the received signals is greater than the threshold the monitoring module provides further instructions to the processor to not adjust the network parameter of the signals received from the second communication network and not adjusting transmission parameters of signals transmitted to the first communication network.",
        "17. The system for adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 15, wherein:\nthe network parameter adjusts times when the received signals are monitored, utilizing a first time slot for processing communications for the first network and a second time slot for monitoring for the received signals, the second time slot not overlapping with the first time slot.",
        "18. The system for adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 17, wherein:\nduring the first time slot, the communication device does not monitor for the received signals.",
        "19. The system for adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 15, wherein:\nthe first network is a cellular network; and\nthe second network is a WLAN communication network.",
        "20. The system for adjusting communication parameters for networks as claimed in claim 15, wherein:\nthe threshold comprises a required sensitivity level for signals at a data rate received from the second network at the communication device, a de-sense value of signals received from the second network due to interference of the first network and a factor incorporating operating conditions of the communication device."
