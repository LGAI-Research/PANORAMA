# PANORAMA Benchmark Samples

This directory contains sample data for the three PANORAMA benchmarks: NOC4PC, PAR4PC, and PI4PC. These samples follow the same format as the data that would be generated by the conversion scripts.

## Directory Structure

```

## File Naming Conventions

### NOC4PC (Novelty and Non-Obviousness Classification)

- Files: `noc4pc_r[record_number]_[application_number]_cl[claim_number].json`
  - Example: `noc4pc_r00001_15091542_cl1.json`

### PAR4PC (Prior-Art Retrieval)

- Files: `par4pc_r[record_number]_[application_number]_cl[claim_number].json`
  - Example: `par4pc_r00011_14704145_cl1.json`

### PI4PC (Paragraph Identification)

- Files: `pi4pc_r[record_number]_[application_number]_cl[claim_number]_[prior_art_id]_[paragraph_number].json`
  - Example: `pi4pc_r00001_15091542_cl1_20050025220_8.json`

## Notes

- These benchmark samples follow the same format and structure as the data that would be generated by the PANORAMA conversion scripts (`convert2bench_*.py`).
- While the format and data structure are identical to real benchmark data, file names and directory paths may differ in actual code execution.
