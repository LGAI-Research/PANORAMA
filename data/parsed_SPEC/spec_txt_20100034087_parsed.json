The external HSDPA flow control between the Node B and the RNC adjusts the Iub/Iur traffic flow to the available throughput at the air interface individually for each HSDPA traffic flow. It may happen that the capacity allocation messages from Node B to RNC result in a total capacity greater than the available Iub/Iur transport capacity, which often is not dimensioned according to the maximum air interface throughput since it is a very expensive resource. Under congestion conditions, packets at the physical and data link layers (e.g. ATM/AAL2 packets) could become lost and the Radio Link Control (RLC) layer has to initiate re-transmissions that significantly degrade the average throughput per HSDPA user."

An example is represented by Core Network procedures such as for instance SRNC relocation. Here the SRNC changes and the values of DRT and FSN transmitted to the Node B by the new SRNC are no longer consistent with those previously transmitted by the old SRNC, since the DRT and FSN values from different RNCs are generally locked to different RFNs, which inevitably exhibit a phase difference. Another possible inconsistency could result from a temporary impossibility for the SRNC to access the RFN. A discontinuity in the received DRT and FSN values would be attributed by the Node B to a congestion situation on the transport network and therefore it would trigger a reduction of the downlink Transmission Credits granted to the SRNC, which is in fact unmotivated. This will result in a decrease of the average throughput in the downlink direction and hence in a worsening of the QoS.

Possible sources of such inconsistency can be an SRNC relocation or the impossibility to access the RFN counter (which is considered part of processor 20) calculating the values of the fields, or other events similarly undetectable by the Node B. Another case in which disabling of the FSN/DRT based measurements can be exploited could be the opportunity or the wish of managing in proprietary manner data flows with different priorities: for instance, the measurements could be disabled for higher priority flows and left operative for lower priority flows, whereby congestion situations are handled by limiting the throughput only for low priority flows."

Signalling the need to reset/restart the TNL congestion detection measurements via the Radio Network Layer Control Plane requires some synchronisation mechanism to have a proper time alignment between Control Plane (RNSAP/NBAP) and User Plane (HS-DSCH FP) protocols. The RNSAP/NBAP message that indicates the reset/restart should in fact be received at the node B exactly when the FSN and DRT based measurements have to be restarted.

When the Node B receives the TNL RESET message, it discards all previously collected FSN and DRT based measurements, but it does not start immediately new ones. This is done only when the \"TNL RESUME\" message is received. With this solution, the SRNC is able to independently control the suspension and the resumption of the Node B measurements. Moreover, the transmission of the CONFIRM/FAILURE messages by the Node B to the SRNC avoids possible deadlock situations following a \"TNL RESET\" or a \"TNL RESUME\" message loss.

To this end, e.g. one bit in that field can be set to a predetermined value. If this solution is adopted, for data frames including a reset command a corresponding flag should be set in the \"New IE Flags\" field in order to signal to the Node B that the Spare Extension contains such new information element."

      "content": "Another and most preferred possibility is based on the consideration that, at wraparound of the FSN count, value \"0\" is not used. According to 3GPP TS 25.435, value \"0\" is a special value used to indicate that the FSN IE shall be treated as spare. Such a value 0 is just used as the disabling command and it is to be inserted by SRNC processor 20 (FIG. 1) into the FSN field of the first frame after recognition of the event originating the need of disabling the congestion detection. SRNC processor 20 is required to insert value 0 also into the FSN field of the first frame after a call set up."

The Figure clearly shows that, by using spare portions of the data frame to send the disabling command to the Node B, the SRNC has no need to suspend the data flow."

In particular, even if the method has been discussed in detail with reference to HSDPA, it can be used in general in all situations where a receiving node manages congestion detection based on information included by a transmitting node into the packet flow and the transmitting node becomes aware of the need or the opportunity of disabling certain congestion detection processes at the receiving node."
