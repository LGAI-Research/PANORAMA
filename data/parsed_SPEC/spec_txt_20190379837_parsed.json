As people routinely carry their portable electronic devices, the photoshoot functionality has drastically increased in use and is a major factor customers consider when purchasing a portable electronic device. A common perception of cameras equipped in portable electronic devices was poor default performance versus digital cameras in the past. The recent growth of lens and image sensor technology along with various camera functions, however, has led to considerable performance advancement in the built-in cameras of portable electronic devices to put them on par with regular digital cameras."

      "content": "As portable electronic device cameras become good enough to replace digital cameras, users can perform expert-class photography and image editing on their portable electronic devices. To prevent image quality deterioration of objects to be photographed or photography environments, portable electronic devices may support various photography modes, such as auto-mode, expert mode, or artificial intelligence (AI) camera mode and provide detailed setting options, such as shutter speed, white balance, International Organization for Standardization (ISO), color, or exposure correction, thereby enabling image capturing adjusted to user taste and preference."

      "content": "With heightened expectations of portable electronic device cameras, recent portable electronic devices are coming up with various capturing modes, e.g., auto-mode, expert mode, or AI camera mode, as well as upgrading capturing functionalities and image quality. For example, the auto-mode sets the parameters to those proposed by the manufacturer or expert group which eliminates the need for separately setting each image option. Despite such convenience, this mode, however, may produce quality deterioration in certain environments and fails to reflect a user's own preference and taste. The expert mode enables detailed adjustment of parameters according to capturing environment and allows the user to obtain high-definition images. However, this mode entails the hassle of resetting the parameters fitting every changing environment and may be difficult to manipulate for normal users with no expertise. The AI camera mode recommends parameter settings fitting the object to be captured or the capturing environment with every capture. By its own limitations, this mode may equivocally classify setting parameters for the user's preference and apply the optimal settings only under some particular conditions."
