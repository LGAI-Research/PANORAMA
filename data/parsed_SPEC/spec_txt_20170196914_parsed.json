      "content": "Mammals are colonized by microbes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, on the skin, and in other epithelial and tissue niches such as the oral cavity, eye surface and vagina. The gastrointestinal tract harbors an abundant and diverse microbial community. It is a complex system, providing an environment or niche for a community of many different species or organisms, including diverse strains of bacteria. Hundreds of different species may form a commensal community in the GI tract in a healthy person, and this complement of organisms evolves from the time of birth to ultimately form a functionally mature microbial population by about 3 years of age. Interactions between microbial strains in these populations and between microbes and the host, e.g. the host immune system, shape the community structure, with availability of and competition for resources affecting the distribution of microbes. Such resources may be food, location and the availability of space to grow or a physical structure to which the microbe may attach. For example, host diet is involved in shaping the GI tract flora."

      "content": "A healthy microbiota provides the host with multiple benefits, including colonization resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens, essential nutrient biosynthesis and absorption, and immune stimulation that maintains a healthy gut epithelium and an appropriately controlled systemic immunity. In settings of ‘dysbiosis’ or disrupted symbiosis, microbiota functions can be lost or deranged, resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogens, altered metabolic profiles, or induction of proinflammatory signals that can result in local or systemic inflammation or autoimmunity. Thus, the intestinal microbiota plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many diseases and disorders, including a variety of pathogenic infections of the gut. For instance, subjects become more susceptible to pathogenic infections when the normal intestinal microbiota has been disturbed due to use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Many of these diseases and disorders are chronic conditions that significantly decrease a subject's quality of life and can be ultimately fatal."

Clade membership of bacterial OTUs is based on 16S sequence data. Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another, and (ii) within 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data, while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont (see Definitions for description of “Pathobiont”). NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as ‘Category-A’, ‘Category-B’, or ‘Category-C’, and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as ‘OP’. OTUs that are not pathogenic or for which their ability to exist as a pathogen is unknown are denoted as ‘N’.

In embodiments involving the complete genome, MLSTs, specific genes, or sets of genes OTUs that share ≧95% average nucleotide identity are considered the same OTU (see e.g. Achtman M, and Wagner M. 2008. Microbial diversity and the genetic nature of microbial species. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 6: 431-440. Konstantinidis K T, Ramette A, and Tiedje J M. 2006. The bacterial species definition in the genomic era. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 361: 1929-1940.). OTUs are frequently defined by comparing sequences between organisms. Generally, sequences with less than 95% sequence identity are not considered to form part of the same OTU. OTUs may also be characterized by any combination of nucleotide markers or genes, in particular highly conserved genes (e.g., “house-keeping” genes), or a combination thereof. Such characterization employs, e.g., WGS data ora whole genome sequence."

      "content": "“Residual habitat products” refers to material derived from the habitat for microbiota within or on a human or animal. For example, microbiota live in feces in the gastrointestinal tract, on the skin itself, in saliva, mucus of the respiratory tract, or secretions of the genitourinary tract (i.e., biological matter associated with the microbial community). Substantially free of residual habitat products means that the bacterial composition no longer contains the biological matter associated with the microbial environment on or in the human or animal subject and is 100% free, 99% free, 98% free, 97% free, 96% free, or 95% free of any contaminating biological matter associated with the microbial community. Residual habitat products can include abiotic materials (including undigested food) or it can include unwanted microorganisms. Substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable cells from a human or animal and that only microbial cells are detectable. In one embodiment, substantially free of residual habitat products may also mean that the bacterial composition contains no detectable viral (including bacterial viruses (i.e., phage)), fungal, mycoplasmal contaminants. In another embodiment, it means that fewer than 1×10.sup.−2%, 1×10.sup.−3%, 1×10.sup.−4%, 1×10.sup.−5%, 1×10.sup.−6%, 1×10.sup.−7%, 1×10.sup.−8 of the viable cells in the bacterial composition are human or animal, as compared to microbial cells. There are multiple ways to accomplish this degree of purity, none of which are limiting. Thus, contamination may be reduced by isolating desired constituents through multiple steps of streaking to single colonies on solid media until replicate (such as, but not limited to, two) streaks from serial single colonies have shown only a single colony morphology. Alternatively, reduction of contamination can be accomplished by multiple rounds of serial dilutions to single desired cells (e.g., a dilution of 10.sup.−8 or 10.sup.−9), such as through multiple 10-fold serial dilutions. This can further be confirmed by showing that multiple isolated colonies have similar cell shapes and Gram staining behavior. Other methods for confirming adequate purity include genetic analysis (e.g. PCR, DNA sequencing), serology and antigen analysis, enzymatic and metabolic analysis, and methods using instrumentation such as flow cytometry with reagents that distinguish desired constituents from contaminants."

A solvent treatment is a miscible solvent treatment (either partially miscible or fully miscible) or an immiscible solvent treatment. Miscibility is the ability of two liquids to mix with each to form a homogeneous solution. Water and ethanol, for example, are fully miscible such that a mixture containing water and ethanol in any ratio will show only one phase. Miscibility is provided as a wt/wt %, or weight of one solvent in 100 g of final solution. If two solvents are fully miscible in all proportions, their miscibility is 100%. Provided as fully miscible solutions with water are alcohols, e.g., methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, propanediol, butanediol, etc. The alcohols can be provided already combined with water; e.g., a solution containing 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 89%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater than 95%.

Preferably the fecal material solution is mixed during the incubation to enhance thermal conductivity and disrupt particulate aggregates. Thermal treatments can be modulated by the temperature of the environment and/or the duration of the thermal treatment. For example, the fecal material or a liquid comprising the fecal material is subjected to a heated environment, e.g., a hot water bath of at least about 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100 or greater than 100 degrees Celsius, for at least about 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 seconds, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, or 50 minutes, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more than 10 hours.

      "content": "In some embodiments, spore-forming bacteria are identified by the presence of nucleic acid sequences that modulate sporulation. In particular, signature sporulation genes are highly conserved across members of distantly related genera including Clostridium and Bacillus. Traditional approaches of forward genetics have identified many, if not all, genes that are essential for sporulation (spo). The developmental program of sporulation is governed in part by the successive action of four compartment-specific sigma factors (appearing in the order σf, σE, σG and σK), whose activities are confined to the forespore (σF and σG) or the mother cell (σE and σK). In other embodiments, spore-forming bacteria are identified by the biochemical activity of DPA producing enzymes or by analyzing DPA content of cultures. As part of the bacterial sporulation, large amounts of DPA are produced, and comprise 5-15% of the mass of a spore. Because not all viable spores germinate and grow under known media conditions, it is difficult to assess a total spore count in a population of bacteria. As such, a measurement of DPA content highly correlates with spore content and is an appropriate measure for characterizing total spore content in a bacterial population."

The bacterial 16S rDNA is approximately 1500 nucleotides in length and is used in reconstructing the evolutionary relationships and sequence similarity of one bacterial isolate to another using phylogenetic approaches. 16S sequences are used for phylogenetic reconstruction as they are in general highly conserved, but contain specific hypervariable regions that harbor sufficient nucleotide diversity to differentiate genera and species of most microbes."

A variety of microbiological media and variations are well known in the art (e.g. R. M. Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media (2010) CRC Press). Medium can be added to the culture at the start, may be added during the culture, or may be intermittently/continuously flowed through the culture.

For bacterial compositions for human use, this is often at 37° C. temperature, pH, and other parameter with values similar to the normal human niche. The environment can be actively controlled, passively controlled (e.g., via buffers), or allowed to drift. For example, for anaerobic bacterial compositions (e.g., gut microbiota), an anoxic/reducing environment can be employed. This can be accomplished by addition of reducing agents such as cysteine to the broth, and/or stripping it of oxygen. As an example, a culture of a bacterial composition can be grown at 37° C., pH 7, in the medium above, pre-reduced with 1 g/L cysteine HCl."

The organisms can be placed into a chemical milieu that protects from freezing (adding tryoprotectants′), drying (‘lyoprotectants’), and/or osmotic shock (‘osmoprotectants’), dispensing into multiple (optionally identical) containers to create a uniform bank, and then treating the culture for preservation. Containers are generally impermeable and have closures that assure isolation from the environment. Cryopreservation treatment is accomplished by freezing a liquid at ultra-low temperatures (e.g., at or below −80° C.). Dried preservation removes water from the culture by evaporation (in the case of spray drying or ‘cool drying’) or by sublimation (e.g., for freeze drying, spray freeze drying). Removal of water improves long-term bacterial composition storage stability at temperatures elevated above cryogenic. If the bacterial composition comprises spore forming species and results in the production of spores, the final composition can be purified by additional means, such as density gradient centrifugation preserved using the techniques described above. Bacterial composition banking can be done by culturing and preserving the strains individually, or by mixing the strains together to create a combined bank. As an example of cryopreservation, a bacterial composition culture can be harvested by centrifugation to pellet the cells from the culture medium, the supernate decanted and replaced with fresh culture broth containing 15% glycerol. The culture can then be aliquoted into 1 mL cryotubes, sealed, and placed at −80° C. for long-term viability retention. This procedure achieves acceptable viability upon recovery from frozen storage."

At the end of cultivation, the culture is harvested to enable further formulation into a dosage form for administration. This can involve concentration, removal of undesirable medium components, and/or introduction into a chemical milieu that preserves the bacterial composition and renders it acceptable for administration via the chosen route. For example, a bacterial composition can be cultivated to a concentration of 10.sup.10 CFU/mL, then concentrated 20-fold by tangential flow microfiltration; the spent medium can be exchanged by diafiltering with a preservative medium consisting of 2% gelatin, 100 mM trehalose, and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer.

Understanding how the bacterial compositions react to the pH of the GI tract also assists in formulation, so that the number of bacteria in a dosage form can be increased if beneficial and/or so that the composition may be administered in an enteric-coated capsule or tablet or with a buffering or protective composition. As the pH of the stomach can drop to a pH of 1 to 2 after a high-protein meal for a short time before physiological mechanisms adjust it to a pH of 3 to 4 and often resides at a resting pH of 4 to 5, and as the pH of the small intestine can range from a pH of 6 to 7.4, bacterial compositions can be prepared that survive these varying pH ranges (specifically wherein at least 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or as much as 100% of the bacteria can survive gut transit times through various pH ranges). This can be tested by exposing the bacterial composition to varying pH ranges for the expected gut transit times through those pH ranges. Therefore, as a nonlimiting example only, 18-hour cultures of bacterial compositions can be grown in standard media, such as gut microbiota medium (“GMM”, see Goodman et al., Extensive personal human gut microbiota culture collections characterized and manipulated in gnotobiotic mice, PNAS 108(15):6252-6257 (2011)) or another animal-products-free medium, with the addition of pH adjusting agents for a pH of 1 to 2 for 30 minutes, a pH of 3 to 4 for 1 hour, a pH of 4 to 5 for 1 to 2 hours, and a pH of 6 to 7.4 for 2.5 to 3 hours.

First, individual colonies can be picked into liquid media in a 96 well format, grown up and saved as 15% glycerol stocks at −80 C. Aliquots of the cultures can be placed into cell lysis buffer and colony PCR methods can be used to amplify and sequence the 16S rDNA gene (Example 2). Alternatively, colonies may be streaked to purity in several passages on solid media. Well separated colonies are streaked onto the fresh plates of the same kind and incubated for 48-72 hours at 37 C. The process is repeated multiple times in order to ensure purity. Pure cultures can be analyzed by phenotypic- or sequence-based methods, including 16S rDNA amplification and sequencing as described in Examples 11 & 12. Sequence characterization of pure isolates or mixed communities e.g. plate scrapes and spore fractions can also include whole genome shotgun sequencing. The latter is valuable to determine the presence of genes associated with sporulation, antibiotic resistance, pathogenicity, and virulence. Colonies can also be scraped from plates en masse and sequenced using a massively parallel sequencing method as described in Examples 11 & 12 such that individual 16S signatures can be identified in a complex mixture. Optionally, the sample can be sequenced prior to germination (if appropriate DNA isolation procedures are used to lsye and release the DNA from spores) in order to compare the diversity of germinable species with the total number of species in a spore sample. As an alternative or complementary approach to 16S analysis, MALDI-TOF-mass spec can also be used for species identification (as reviewed in Anaerobe 22:123).\n\nExample 11: 16s Sequencing to Determine Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU)"

A similar approach can be used to annotate protein names, transcription factor names, and any other classification schema for nucleic acid sequences. Sequence similarity based methods include those familiar to individuals skilled in the art including, but not limited to BLAST, BLASTx, tBLASTn, tBLASTx, RDP-classifier, DNAclust, and various implementations of these algorithms such as Qiime or Mothur. These methods rely on mapping a sequence read to a reference database and selecting the match with the best score and e-value. Common databases include, but are not limited to the Human Microbiome Project, NCBI non-redundant database, Greengenes, RDP, and Silva. Phylogenetic methods can be used in combination with sequence similarity methods to improve the calling accuracy of an annotation or taxonomic assignment. Here tree topologies and nodal structure are used to refine the resolution of the analysis. In this approach we analyze nucleic acid sequences using one of numerous sequence similarity approaches and leverage phylogenetic methods that are well known to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction (see e.g. Liu K, Linder C R, and Warnow T. 2011.

Statistical measures of uncertainty for branches in phylogenetic trees inferred from molecular sequences by using model-based methods. J. Appl. Genet. 49: 49-67.) Sequence reads are placed into a reference phylogeny comprised of appropriate reference sequences. Annotations are made based on the placement of the read in the phylogenetic tree. The certainty or significance of the OTU annotation is defined based on the OTU's sequence similarity to a reference nucleic acid sequence and the proximity of the OTU sequence relative to one or more reference sequences in the phylogeny. As an example, the specificity of a taxonomic assignment is defined with confidence at the the level of Family, Genus, Species, or Strain with the confidence determined based on the position of bootstrap supported branches in the reference phylogenetic tree relative to the placement of the OTU sequence being interrogated."

Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation. Given the topological nature of a phylogenetic tree and the fact that tree represents hierarchical relationships of OTUs to one another based on their sequence similarity and an underlying evolutionary model, taxonomic annotations of a read can be rolled up to a higher level using a clade-based assignment procedure (Table 1). Using this approach, clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood or other phylogenetic models familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another (generally, 1-5 bootstraps), and (ii) within a 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. The power of clade based analysis is that members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, are likely to play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention."

Germinants can include amino-acids (e.g., alanine, glycine), sugars (e.g., fructose), nucleosides (e.g., inosine), bile salts (e.g., cholate and taurocholate), metal cations (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+), fatty acids, and long-chain alkyl amines (e.g., dodecylamine, Germination of bacterial spores with alkyl primary amines” J. Bacteriology, 1961.). Mixtures of these or more complex natural mixtures, such as rumen fluid or Oxgall, can be used to induce germination. Oxgall is dehydrated bovine bile composed of fatty acids, bile acids, inorganic salts, sulfates, bile pigments, cholesterol, mucin, lecithin, glycuronic acids, porphyrins, and urea. The germination can also be performed in a growth medium like prereduced BHIS/oxgall germination medium, in which BHIS (Brain heart infusion powder (37 g/L), yeast extract (5 g/L), L-cysteine HCl (1 g/L)) provides peptides, amino acids, inorganic ions and sugars in the complex BHI and yeast extract mixtures and Oxgall provides additional bile acid germinants."

Different species require different germinants and different isolates of the same species can require different germinants for optimal germination. Finally, it is important to dilute the mixture prior to plating because some germinants are inhibitory to growth of the vegetative-state microorganisms. For instance, it has been shown that alkyl amines must be neutralized with anionic lipophiles in order to promote optimal growth. Bile acids can also inhibit growth of some organisms despite promoting their germination, and must be diluted away prior to plating for viable cells."

The final alcohol concentration can range from 30-90%, preferably 50-70%. High speed centrifugation (3200 rcf for 10 min) is performed to remove solvent and the pellet is retained and washed. Subsequently, once the washed pellet is resuspended, a low speed centrifugation step (200 rcf for 4 min) is performed to remove large particulate vegetative matter and the supernatant containing the spores is retained. High speed centrifugation (3200 rcf for 10 min) is performed on the supernatant to concentrate the spore material. The pellet is then washed and resuspended to generate a 20% slurry. This is the ethanol treated spore preparation. The concentrated slurry is then separated with a density based gradient e.g. a CsCl gradient, sucrose gradient or combination of the two generating a ethanol treated, gradient-purified spore preparation. For example, a CsCl gradient is performed by loading a 20% volume of spore suspension on top a 80% volume of a stepwise CsCl gradient (w/v) containing the steps of 64%, 50%, 40% CsCl (w/v) and centrifuging for 20 min at 3200 rcf. The spore fraction is then run on a sucrose step gradient with steps of 67%, 50%, 40%, and 30% (w/v). When centrifuged in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 3200 rcf. The spores run roughly in the 30% and 40% sucrose fractions. The lower spore fraction (FIG. 2) is then removed and washed to produce a concentrated ethanol treated, gradient-purified spore preparation. Taking advantage of the refractive properties of spores observed by phase contrast microscopy (spores are bright and refractive while germinated spores and vegetative cells are dark) one can see an enrichment of the spore fraction from a fecal bacterial cell suspension (FIG. 3, left) compared to an ethanol treated, CsCl gradient purified, spore preparation (FIG. 3, center), and to an ethanol treated, CsCl gradient purified, sucrose gradient purified, spore preparation (FIG. 3, right)."

One possible reason for the difference in spore content measures is that nonviable spores and non-germinable spores will not be observed by plating but will have measurable DPA content.

Alternatively, a key metabolite of bacterial spores, dipicolinic acid (DPA) has been developed to quantify spores particles in a sample and avoid interference from fecal contaminants.

If that SCFU dose was used to normalize dosing in a clinical setting, however, then the actual spore doses given to patients would be much lower for other ethanol treated spore preparations as measured as by the DPA assay (Table AD).\n\nTABLE-US-00002 TABLE AD DPA doses in Table AC when normalized to 4 × 10.sup.5 SCFU per dose SCFU/ DPA SEq/30 Fraction of Preparation 1 Preparation 30 capsules capsules Dose Preparation 1 4.0 × 10{circumflex over ( )}5 6.8 × 10{circumflex over ( )}7 1.0 Preparation 2 4.0 × 10{circumflex over ( )}5 1.8 × 10{circumflex over ( )}7 0.26 Preparation 3 4.0 × 10{circumflex over ( )}5 5.6 × 10{circumflex over ( )}5 0.0082"

For instance, setting a dose specification of 4×10.sup.5 SCFU (the apparent effective dose from donor Preparation 1) for product Preparation 3 would lead to a potential underdosing of more than 100-fold. This can be rectified only by setting potency specifications based on the DPA assay, which better reflects total spore counts in an ethanol treated spore preparation. The unexpected finding of this work is that the DPA assay is uniquely suited to set potency and determine dosing for an ethanol treated spore preparation.\n\nExample 22: Demonstration of Enhanced Growth with a Germinant"

Comparing the number of Bacteroides fragilis groups species per cfu/g of feces pre-treatment and in week 4 post treatment reveals an increase of 4 logs or greater. The ability of 16S-V4 OTU identification to assign an OTU as a specific species depends in part on the resolution of the 16S-V4 region of the 16S gene for a particular species or group of species. Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation to a given sequence read. Given the topological nature of a phylogenetic tree and that the tree represents hierarchical relationships of OTUs to one another based on their sequence similarity and an underlying evolutionary model, taxonomic annotations of a read can be rolled up to a higher level using a clade-based assignment procedure (Table 1). Using this approach, clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood or other phylogenetic models familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another (generally, 1-5 bootstraps), and (ii) within a 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. The power of clade based analysis is that members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention."

These striking data are evidence of a profoundly dysbiotic microbiota associated with recurrent C. difficile infection and chronic antibiotic use. In healthy individuals, Klebsiella is a resident of the human microbiome in only about 2% of subjects based on an analysis of HMP database (www.hmpdacc.org), and the mean relative abundance of Klebsiella is only about 0.09% in the stool of these people. It's surprising presence at 20% relative abundance in Patient 1 before treatment is an indicator of a proinflammatory gut environment enabling a “pathobiont” to overgrow and outcompete the commensal organisms normally found in the gut. Similarly, the dramatic overgrowth of Fusobacterium indicates a profoundly dysbiotic gut microbiota. One species of Fusobacterium, F. nucleatum (an OTU phylogenetically indistinguishable from Fusobacterium sp. 3_1_33 based on 16S-V4), has been termed “an emerging gut pathogen” based on its association with IBD, Crohn's disease, and colorectal cancer in humans and its demonstrated causative role in the development of colorectal cancer in animal models [Allen-Vercoe, Gut Microbes (2011) 2:294-8].

Viable Bacteroides fragilis group species were not present in the ethanol treated spore population based on microbiological plating (limit of detection of 10 cfu/ml). Thus, administration of the ethanol treated spore population to Patient 1 resulted not only in the engraftment of spore-forming species, but also the restoration of high levels of non-spore forming species commonly found in healthy individuals through the creation of a niche that allowed for the repopulation of Bacteroides species. These organisms were most likely either present at extremely low abundance in the GI tract of Patient 1, or present in a reservoir in the GI tract from which they could rebound to high titer. Those species may also be reinoculated via oral uptake from food following treatment. We term this healthy repopulation of the gut with OTUs that are not present in the ethanol treated spore population “Augmentation.” Augmentation is an important phenomenon in that it shows the ability to use an ethanol treated spore ecology to restore a healthy microbiota by seeding a diverse array or commensal organisms beyond the actual component organisms in the ethanol treated spore population itself; specifically the spore treatment itself and the engraftment of OTUs from the spore composition create a niche that enables the outgrowth of OTUs required to shift a dysbiotic microbiome to a microbial ecology that is associated with health.

In the clinical setting, these species are considered resistant to imipenem if they have an MIC of 1 ug/mL or greater. M. morganii isolates from pretreatment samples from Patient D had MICs of 2-4 ug/mL and P. pennerii isolates had MICs of 4-8 ug/mL. Thus the ethanol treated spore population administered to Patient 4 caused the clearance of 2 imipenem resistant organisms (Table 16).\n\nExample 26. Enrichment and Purification of Bacteria"

Colonies were picked with a sterile implement (either a sterile loop or toothpick) and re-streaked to BBA or other solid media. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 3-7 days. One or more well-isolated single colonies of the major morphology type were re-streaked. This process was repeated at least three times until a single, stable colony morphology is observed. The isolated microbe was then cultured anaerobically in liquid media for 24 hours or longer to obtain a pure culture of 10.sup.6-10.sup.10 cfu/ml. Liquid growth medium might include Brain Heart Infusion-based medium (Atlas, Handbook of Microbiological Media, 4th ed, ASM Press, 2010) supplemented with yeast extract, hemin, cysteine, and carbohydrates (for example, maltose, cellobiose, soluble starch) or other media described previously (e.g. see example 14). The culture was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min to pellet the bacteria, the spent culture media was removed, and the bacteria were resuspended in sterile PBS. Sterile 75% glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%. An aliquot of glycerol stock was titered by serial dilution and plating.

Single colonies were then picked and used to inoculate 250 ml to 1 L of Wilkins-Chalgren broth, Brain-Heart Infusion broth, M2GSC broth or other growth media, and grown to mid to late exponential phase or into the stationary phase of growth. Alternatively, the single colonies may be used to inoculate a pilot culture of 10 ml, which were then used to inoculate a large volume culture. The growth media and the growth phase at harvest were selected to enhance cell titer, sporulation (if desired) and phenotypes that might be associated desired in vitro or in vivo. Optionally, Cultures were grown static or shaking, depending which yielded maximal cell titer. The cultures were then concentrated 10 fold or more by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min, and resuspended in sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) plus 15% glycerol. 1 ml aliquots were transferred into 1.8 ml cryovials which were then frozen on dry ice and stored at −80 C. The identity of a given cell bank was confirmed by PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA gene, followed by Sanger direct cycle sequencing, and comparison to a curated rDNA database to determine a taxonomic ID. Each bank was confirmed to yield colonies of a single morphology upon streaking to Brucella blood agar or M2GSC agar. When more than one morphology was observed, colonies were confirmed to be the expected species by PCR and sequencing analysis of the 16S rDNA gene. Variant colony morphologies can be observed within pure cultures, and in a variety of bacteria the mechanisms of varying colony morphologies have been well described (van der Woude, Clinical Microbiology Reviews, 17:518, 2004), including in Clostridium species (Wadsworth-KTL Anaerobic Bacteriology Manual, 6th Ed, Jousimie-Somer, et al 2002).

The microbiota and resulting microbiome comprise an ecology of microorganisms that co-exist within single subjects interacting with one another and their host (i.e., the mammalian subject) to form a dynamic unit with inherent biodiversity and functional characteristics. Within these networks of interacting microbes (i.e. ecologies), particular members can contribute more significantly than others; as such these members are also found in many different ecologies, and the loss of these microbes from the ecology can have a significant impact on the functional capabilities of the specific ecology. Robert Paine coined the concept “Keystone Species” in 1969 (see Paine RT. 1969. A note on trophic complexity and community stability. The American Naturalist 103: 91-93.) to describe the existence of such lynchpin species that are integral to a given ecosystem regardless of their abundance in the ecological community. Paine originally describe the role of the starfish Pisaster ochraceus in marine systems and since the concept has been experimentally validated in numerous ecosystems."

Keystone OTUs and/or Functions are defined as all Nodes within a defined set of networks that meet two or more of the following criteria. Using Criterion 1, the node is frequently observed in networks, and the networks in which the node is observed are found in a large number of individual subjects; the frequency of occurrence of these Nodes in networks and the pervasiveness of the networks in individuals indicates these Nodes perform an important biological function in many individuals. Using Criterion 2, the node is frequently observed in networks, and each the networks in which the node is observed contain a large number of Nodes—these Nodes are thus “super-connectors”, meaning that they form a nucleus of a majority of networks and as such have high biological significance with respect to their functional contributions to a given ecology. Using Criterion 3, the node is found in networks containing a large number of Nodes (i.e. they are large networks), and the networks in which the node is found occur in a large number of subjects; these networks are potentially of high interest as it is unlikely that large networks occurring in many individuals would occur by chance alone strongly suggesting biological relevance. Optionally, the required thresholds for the frequency at which a node is observed in network ecologies, the frequency at which a given network is observed across subject samples, and the size of a given network to be considered a Keystone node are defined by the 50th, 70th, 80th, or 90th percentiles of the distribution of these variables. Optionally, the required thresholds are defined by the value for a given variable that is significantly different from the mean or median value for a given variable using standard parametric or non-parametric measures of statistical significance. In another embodiment a Keystone node is defined as one that occurs in a sample phenotype of interest such as but not limited to “health” and simultaneously does not occur in a sample phenotype that is not of interest such as but not limited to “disease.” Optionally, a Keystone Node is defined as one that is shown to be significantly different from what is observed using permuted test datasets to measure significance.\n\nExample 31.

A requirement to detect at least ten sequence reads in the ethanol treated spore preparation was set as a conservative threshold to define only OTUs that were highly unlikely to arise from errors during amplification or sequencing.

Engraftment is important for two reasons. First, engraftment is a sine qua non of the mechanism to reshape the microbiome and eliminate C. difficile colonization. OTUs that engraft with higher frequency are highly likely to be a component of the Core Ecology of the spore preparation. Second, OTUs detected by sequencing the spore preparation (as in Table GB) may include non-viable spores or other contaminant DNA molecules not associated with spores. The requirement that an OTU must be shown to engraft in the patient eliminates OTUs that represent non-viable spores or contaminating sequences. Table GB also identifies all OTUs detected in the spore preparation that also were shown to engraft in at least one patient post-treatment. OTUs that are present in a large percentage of the ethanol spore preparations analyzed and that engraft in a large number of patients represent a subset of the Core Ecology that are highly likely to catalyze the shift from a dysbiotic disease ecology to a healthy microbiome."

Keystone OTUs form a foundation to the microbially ecologies in that they are found and as such are central to the function of network ecologies in healthy subjects. Keystone OTUs associated with microbial ecologies associated with healthy subjects are often are missing or exist at reduced levels in subjects with disease. Keystone OTUs may exist in low, moderate, or high abundance in subjects.

This is surprising because the HMP database (www.hmpdacc.org) describes the enormous variability of commensal species across healthy individuals. The presence of a small number of consistent OTUs lends support to the concept of a Core Ecology. The engraftment data further supports this conclusion. A regression analysis shows a significant correlation between frequency of detection in a spore preparation and frequency of engraftment in a donor: R=0.43 (p<0.001). There is no a priori requirement that an OTU detected frequently in the spore preparation will or should engraft. For instance, Lutispora thermophila, a spore former found in all ten spore preparations, did not engraft in any of the patients. Bilophila wadsworthia, a gram negative anaerobe, is present in 9 of 10 donations, yet it does not engraft in any patient, indicating that it is likely a non-viable contaminant in the ethanol treated spore preparation.

This redundancy makes it highly likely that subsets of the Core Ecology describe therapeutically beneficial components of the ethanol treated spore preparation and that such subsets may themselves be useful compositions for the treatment of C. difficile infection given the ecologies functional characteristics. Using the CES, individual OTUs can be prioritized for evaluation as an efficacious subset of the Core Ecology."

      "content": "To one skilled in the art, the selection of appropriate OTU subsets for testing in vitro (e.g. see Example 33 below) or in vivo (e.g. see Examples 16 or 17) is straightforward. Subsets may be selected by picking any 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more than 10 OTUs from Table GB, with a particular emphasis on those with higher CES, such as the OTUs described in Table GC. In addition, using the clade relationships defined in Example 12 and Table 1 above, related OTUs can be selected as substitutes for OTUs with acceptable CES values. These organisms can be cultured anaerobically in vitro using the appropriate media (selected from those described in Example 14 above), and then combined in a desired ratio. A typical experiment in the mouse C. difficile model utilizes at least 10.sup.4 and preferably at least 10.sup.5, 10.sup.6, 10.sup.7, 10.sup.8, 10.sup.9 or more than 10.sup.9 colony forming units of a each microbe in the composition. Variations in the culture yields may sometimes mean that organisms are combined in unequal ratios, e.g. 1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000, 1:100,000, or greater than 1:100,000. What is important in these compositions is that each strain be provided in a minimum amount so that the strain's contribution to the efficacy of the Core Ecology subset can be measured. Using the principles and instructions described here, it is straightforward for one of skill in the art to make clade-based substitutions to test the efficacy of subsets of the Core Ecology. Table GB describes the clades for each OTU detected in a spore preparation and Table 1 describes the OTUs that can be used for substitutions based on clade relationships.\n\nExample 33.

First, there are a group of OTUs with no sequence reads on Day −1 that show subsequent and large numbers of sequence reads on Days 2, 3, or 4; this group includes Cl. butyricum, Cl. hylemonae, Cl. orbiscindens, Cl. symbiosum, and L. bacterium_5_1_57 FAA. Cl. disporicum is comparable to this group as it has sequence reads on Day −1 that are very close to background (10 and 29 in compositions 1 and 2, respectively), which subsequently increase by as much as 1000-fold on Days 2, 3 or 4. Second, there are OTUs such as Co. aerofaciens, C. comes, R. bromii, B. producta, Cl. bolteae, Cl. mayombei, Cl. innocuum, Cl. tertium and R. gnavus which are not detectable at the OTU level in either the Day −1 sample or in subsequent samples. In composition 2, Co. aerofaciens is detected transiently on Day 2 in the 1×10.sup.8 and 1×10.sup.7 dose groups; E. rectale in the same experimental groups is detected on Day 3, suggesting a possible relationship between transient population by Co. aerofaciens followed by E. rectale in these groups of mice. A striking observation is that the observed number of OTU sequence reads is not highly dose dependent. Overall, the data is consistent with a model whereby OTUs populate rapidly following oral administration."

      "content": "The clade-based analysis in Table TAC was performed to more thoroughly evaluate the population of the GI tract. Clade-based analysis obscures some of the details afforded by an OTU analysis. For instance, Cl. tertium and Cl. butyricum are members of the same clade and thus a clade-based analysis cannot distinguish the dynamics of these individual OTUs. However, clade-based analysis has the compensatory benefit that it is sensitive to measuring population changes that can be missed by an OTU-based analysis. The ability of 16S-V4 OTU identification to assign an OTU as a specific species depends in part on the resolving power of the 16S-V4 region for a particular species or group of species. Both the density of available reference 16S sequences for different regions of the tree as well as the inherent variability in the 16S gene between different species will determine the definitiveness of a taxonomic annotation. So in some cases, the population of a species can be followed using clade-based assignments when OTU based-detection is insensitive in a complex population. For instance, the clade-based analysis in Table 2B supports the case that R. bromii, B. producta, Cl. innocuum, and R. gnavus were able to populate since each OTU is a sole member of a clade in the microbial compositions and sequence reads went from undetectable on Day −1 to well above background on Days 2, 3 or 4. 16S V4 sequencing and clade-based analysis could not determine whether Cl. tertium or Cl. bolteae populated due to the fact that other members of their clades (Cl. butyricum and Cl. symbiosum, respectively) were present and shown to populate at the OTU level in the mice."

In recent years, the numbers of infections caused by organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile have increased markedly, and many of these strains are acquiring resistance to the few remaining active antibiotics. Most infections produced by highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria are acquired during hospitalizations, and preventing patient-to-patient transmission of these pathogens is one of the major challenges confronting hospitals and clinics. Most highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belong to genera that colonize mucosal surfaces, usually at low densities. The highly complex microbiota that normally colonizes mucosal surfaces inhibits expansion of and domination by bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae. Destruction of the normal flora by antibiotic administration, however, disinhibition antibiotic-resistant members of these bacterial families, leading to their expansion to very high densities (Ubeda et al Journal of Clinical Investigation 2010). High-density colonization by these organisms can be calamitous for the susceptible patient, resulting in bacteremia and sepsis (Taur et al, Clinical Infectious Disease, 2012)."

KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains often harbor resistance determinants against several other classes of antimicrobials, including aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, resulting in truly multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms (Hirsch et al, Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, 2009).

Clades are defined based on the topology of a phylogenetic tree that is constructed from full-length 16S sequences using maximum likelihood methods familiar to individuals with ordinary skill in the art of phylogenetics. Clades are constructed to ensure that all OTUs in a given clade are: (i) within a specified number of bootstrap supported nodes from one another, and (ii) within 5% genetic similarity. OTUs that are within the same clade can be distinguished as genetically and phylogenetically distinct from OTUs in a different clade based on 16S-V4 sequence data, while OTUs falling within the same clade are closely related. OTUs falling within the same clade are evolutionarily closely related and may or may not be distinguishable from one another using 16S-V4 sequence data. Members of the same clade, due to their evolutionary relatedness, play similar functional roles in a microbial ecology such as that found in the human gut. Compositions substituting one species with another from the same clade are likely to have conserved ecological function and therefore are useful in the present invention. All OTUs are denoted as to their putative capacity to form spores and whether they are a Pathogen or Pathobiont (see Definitions for description of “Pathobiont”). NIAID Priority Pathogens are denoted as ‘Category-A’, ‘Category-B’, or ‘Category-C’, and Opportunistic Pathogens are denoted as ‘OP’.
