  "CTNFBodyText": "\n\n    DETAILED ACTION\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC ยง 103\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 103 which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\nA patent for a claimed invention may not be obtained, notwithstanding that the claimed invention is not identically disclosed as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\nClaims 1-2 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 103 as being unpatentable over Rebmann (US Pub No 2018/0179985) in view of Wang et al. (US Pub No 2018/0298842).\nIn regard to claim 1,\nRebmann discloses a cylinder liner (see Figs 3d and 6) that is casted in a block (Paragraph 0022)and defines a cylinder bore (2a, Fig 3d) corresponding to one cylinder, comprising:\na cylindrical liner body (1, Figs 3d and 6);\nan outer peripheral surface (best seen in Fig 6, to include generally the inner walls of gap 6a between each bore, along with the โbulkโ of the exterior of the liner)\na bore adjacent part (gap 6a, Figs 3d and 6) formed such that the outer peripheral surface at an upper side end of the liner body is positioned more on an inner side of the liner body than the outer peripheral surface below the upper side end (gap 6a generally forming a step โin towardsโ the bore 2a (best seen in Fig 3d), versus the thickness at the โbottomโ of gap 6a).\nRebmann does not positively disclose:\na projection part provided so as to include a plurality of projections on the outer peripheral surface of a part of the liner body; or\nwherein the projections are absent on at least a part of the outer peripheral surface at the upper side end, in a predetermined range of the outer peripheral surface of the liner body, which faces another cylinder bore to be adjacent when casted in the block.\nHowever, it is very well known in the art to configure cylinder liners with โprojectionsโ formed on the exterior surfaces, where said surfaces mate with engine blocks into which they are installed. For example,\nWang discloses a cylinder liner (Title) arrangement, wherein the exterior surfaces of the liner elements are provided with projections (see Fig 3a). Wang teaches that: (Paragraph 0035) such a configuration โprovides an excellent structural and thermal bond through mechanical locking between the liner and the engine block materialโ and (Paragraph 0038) โFIG. 3A clearly illustrates the intimacy that results from the use of a cylinder liner having an as-cast rough surface which provides a relatively high coefficient of thermal transfer between the cylinder liner 304 and the engine block 300.โ.\nIt would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to configure the portions of the outer surfaces of the liner with such projections where the liner mates with its engine block (so, not the area of gaps 6a) in order to provide an excellent structural and thermal bond between the liner and block as taught by Wang.\nIn regard to claim 2,\nRebmann modified supra discloses the liner of claim 1, further comprising a positioning part (considered to be the โflangeโ surrounding the liner sections, as seen in Fig 6) provided so as to be at a predetermined relative position to the bore adjacent part (all being formed as a single structure, the flange generally keeping the position of each liner section relative to the others) such that the bore adjacent part is positioned at a predetermined position facing the other adjacent cylinder bore when casted in the block (gaps 6a being located between each of bores 2a-2d).\n\nAllowable Subject Matter\nClaims 3-6 are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but appear that they would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\nClaims 7-8 appear to contain allowable subject matter.\n\nConclusion\n",

          "reason": "Regarding Claim 1, Rebmann (US 20180179985) discloses a cylinder liner (see Figs 3d and 6) that is casted in a block (Paragraph 0022) and defines a cylinder bore (2a, Fig 3d) corresponding to one cylinder, comprising: a cylindrical liner body (1, Figs 3d and 6); an outer peripheral surface (best seen in Fig 6, to include generally the inner walls of gap 6a between each bore, along with the 'bulk' of the exterior of the liner) a bore adjacent part (gap 6a, Figs 3d and 6) formed such that the outer peripheral surface at an upper side end of the liner body is positioned more on an inner side of the liner body than the outer peripheral surface below the upper side end (gap 6a generally forming a step 'in towards' the bore 2a (best seen in Fig 3d), versus the thickness at the 'bottom' of gap 6a). Rebmann does not positively disclose: a projection part provided so as to include a plurality of projections on the outer peripheral surface of a part of the liner body; or wherein the projections are absent on at least a part of the outer peripheral surface at the upper side end, in a predetermined range of the outer peripheral surface of the liner body, which faces another cylinder bore to be adjacent when casted in the block. However, it is very well known in the art to configure cylinder liners with 'projections' formed on the exterior surfaces, where said surfaces mate with engine blocks into which they are installed. Wang (US 20180298842) discloses a cylinder liner (Title) arrangement, wherein the exterior surfaces of the liner elements are provided with projections (see Fig 3a). Wang teaches that: (Paragraph 0035) such a configuration 'provides an excellent structural and thermal bond through mechanical locking between the liner and the engine block material' and (Paragraph 0038) 'FIG. 3A clearly illustrates the intimacy that results from the use of a cylinder liner having an as-cast rough surface which provides a relatively high coefficient of thermal transfer between the cylinder liner 304 and the engine block 300.'. It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to configure the portions of the outer surfaces of the liner with such projections where the liner mates with its engine block (so, not the area of gaps 6a) in order to provide an excellent structural and thermal bond between the liner and block as taught by Wang."
