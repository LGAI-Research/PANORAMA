Balakrishnan does not explicitly disclose a set of wireless sensor modules, each of the set of wireless sensor modules configured to be received by and removably coupled to the retention subsystem of a corresponding wireless sensor interface of the set of wireless sensor interfaces, and a control module, communicatively coupled to the set of wireless sensor modules, wherein, based upon a detected position of each of the set of wireless sensor modules, the control module queries a subset of the set of biometric signal types for transmission from each of the set of wireless sensor modules.

Therefore it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention to modify the system in Balakrishnan to use a subset of the sensors as taught by Esposito. The motivation for such a modification would be to increase the flexibility of the system by allowing the users to choose which parameters to monitor as well as saving power by not activating the sensors that are not of interest.
