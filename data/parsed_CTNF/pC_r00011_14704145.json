Graff does not disclose receiving, by one or more computer processors, a request for information from a computer system associated with a first participant of the one or more participants of the physical gathering; determining, by one or more computer processors, whether the first participant has access to the information requested based on the profile for the first participant; responsive to determining that the first participant has access to the information requested, analyzing, by one or more computer processors, the data received from the one or more computer systems associated with the one or more participants of the physical gathering to identify data to provide to the first participant to fulfill the request for information; and providing, by one or more computer processors, the identified data to the computer system associated with the first participant of the physical gathering. Klemm (US 20150379478) discloses receiving, by one or more computer processors, a request for information (requests and queries for information) from a computer system (communication terminal) associated with a first participant (event attendee) of the one or more participants of the physical gathering (the event); (see paragraphs 0010, 0011, 0033-0035, Fig. 1A) determining, by one or more computer processors, whether the first participant has access to the information requested based on the profile for the first participant; (paragraphs 0063, 0064) responsive to determining that the first participant has access to the information requested, analyzing, by one or more computer processors, the data received from the one or more computer systems associated with the one or more participants of the physical gathering to identify data to provide to the first participant to fulfill the request for information; and (paragraphs 0061, 0063-0065) providing, by one or more computer processors, the identified data to the computer system associated with the first participant of the physical gathering. (paragraphs 0061, 0063-0065) It would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention to modify Graff in view of Klemm in order to receive, by one or more computer processors, a request for information from a computer system associated with a first participant of the one or more participants of the physical gathering; determine, by one or more computer processors, whether the first participant has access to the information requested based on the profile for the first participant; responsive to determining that the first participant has access to the information requested, analyze, by one or more computer processors, the data received from the one or more computer systems associated with the one or more participants of the physical gathering to identify data to provide to the first participant to fulfill the request for information; and provide, by one or more computer processors, the identified data to the computer system associated with the first participant of the physical gathering. One of ordinary skill in the art would have been motivated because it would further enhance an event participant user experience of by allowing to request specific information in addition to receiving information that is pushed to the event participant."
