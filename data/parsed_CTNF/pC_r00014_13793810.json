In one embodiment, Hawkes discloses applying the keystream to plaintext to generate an encrypted message block having at least a portion of the plaintext converted to ciphertext, and updating the state value as a function of said at least a portion of the plaintext (Hawkes:abstract; pars. 0008, 0010).
