    "CTNFBodyText": "\n\n    DETAILED ACTION\n\nNotice of Pre-AIA  or AIA  Status\nThe present application is being examined under the pre-AIA  first to invent provisions.\n\nInformation Disclosure Statement\nThe information disclosure statements (IDS) submitted on 12/13/2018 and 07/29/2019 were filed after the filing date of the instant application. The submission is in compliance with the provisions of 37 CFR 1.97. Accordingly, the information disclosure statement is being considered by the examiner.\n\nClaim Objections\nClaims 4-8 are objected to because of the following informalities:\nThe recitation of “of the sensed temperature” (Claim 4, line 21) is believed to be --of the sensed pressure--.\nClaims 5-8 are objected based upon their dependency from claim 4.\nAppropriate correction is required.\n\nDouble Patenting\nThe nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the “right to exclude” granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); In re Longi, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Van Ornum, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); In re Vogel, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); In re Thorington, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).\nA timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(c) or 1.321(d) may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on nonstatutory double patenting provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with the examined application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. See MPEP § 717.02 for applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA  as explained in MPEP § 2159.  See MPEP §§ 706.02(l)(1) - 706.02(l)(3) for applications not subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA . A terminal disclaimer must be signed in compliance with 37 CFR 1.321(b). \nThe USPTO Internet website contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be used. Please visit www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms. The filing date of the application in which the form is filed determines what form (e.g., PTO/SB/25, PTO/SB/26, PTO/AIA /25, or PTO/AIA /26) should be used. A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled out completely online using web-screens. An eTerminal Disclaimer that meets all requirements is auto-processed and approved immediately upon submission.

Although the claims at issue are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because claim 2 of this application is anticipated by claim 1 of the patent as both claims are drawn to the same structural limitations of a two-stage cascade refrigeration system including a cabinet, a first refrigeration stage, a second refrigeration stage, a heat exchanger in fluid communication with both stages; the second compressor being a variable speed compressor; a controller operatively coupled to the first and second compressors; a sensor coupled to the controller to sense a temperature of the cabinet; and the controller operating the second compressor at a first speed and then increasing the speed of the second compressor. The difference between the scope of claim 2 of the instant application and claim 1 of the patent is that claim 2 of the instant application is a broader claim. However, one having ordinary skill in the art would recognize that claim 2 of the instant application is anticipated by claim 1 of the patent.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC § 112\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112(b):\n(b)  CONCLUSION.—The specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention.\n\n\nThe following is a quotation of 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph:\nThe specification shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\n\n\nClaims 1-31 are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA ), second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor, or for pre-AIA  the applicant regards as the invention.\nClaim limitation “first expansion device” and “second expansion device” invokes 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph. However, the written description fails to disclose the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the entire claimed function and to clearly link the structure, material, or acts to the function. Therefore, the claim is indefinite and is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph.\nApplicant may:\n(a)        Amend the claim so that the claim limitation will no longer be interpreted as a limitation under 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph; \n(b)        Amend the written description of the specification such that it expressly recites what structure, material, or acts perform the entire claimed function, without introducing any new matter (35 U.S.C. 132(a)); or \n(c)        Amend the written description of the specification such that it clearly links the structure, material, or acts disclosed therein to the function recited in the claim, without introducing any new matter (35 U.S.C. 132(a)).\nIf applicant is of the opinion that the written description of the specification already implicitly or inherently discloses the corresponding structure, material, or acts and clearly links them to the function so that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize what structure, material, or acts perform the claimed function, applicant should clarify the record by either: \n(a)        Amending the written description of the specification such that it expressly recites the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed function and clearly links or associates the structure, material, or acts to the claimed function, without introducing any new matter (35 U.S.C. 132(a)); or \n(b)        Stating on the record what the corresponding structure, material, or acts, which are implicitly or inherently set forth in the written description of the specification, perform the claimed function. For more information, see 37 CFR 1.75(d) and MPEP §§ 608.01(o) and 2181.\n\nClaims 5-8, 15-19, 21-26 and 28-31 are rejected based upon their dependency from claims 4, 14, 20 and 27. \n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC § 102\nThe following is a quotation of the appropriate paragraphs of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102 that form the basis for the rejections under this section made in this Office action:\nA person shall be entitled to a patent unless –\n\n(b) the invention was patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country or in public use or on sale in this country, more than one year prior to the date of application for patent in the United States.\n\n\nClaim(s) 4-7 and 9-12 is/are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 102(b) as being anticipated by Sakae (JP 2008-008593 A, refer to the attached translation).\nRegarding claim 4, Sakae discloses a two-stage cascade refrigeration system (refer to Fig. 1) comprising: \na first refrigeration stage (1a) defining a first fluid circuit for circulating a first refrigerant, the first refrigeration stage having a first compressor (20), a condenser (24), and a first expansion device (in the instant case, expansion mechanism 26 is being considered as the first expansion device) in fluid communication with the first fluid circuit; \na second refrigeration stage (1b) defining a second fluid circuit for circulating a second refrigerant, the second refrigeration stage having a second compressor (2), a second expansion device (in the instant case, expansion mechanism 10 is being considered as the second expansion device), and an evaporator (12) in fluid communication with the second fluid circuit; \na heat exchanger (8) in fluid communication with the first and second fluid circuits  to exchange heat between the first and second refrigerants (by means of conduits 8a and 8b);\nwherein the first compressor (20) and the second compressor (2) are variable speed compressors (refer to the first lines of paragraphs 8 and 9, wherein both compressors are of variable capacity);\nat least one controller (32) operatively coupled to the first (20) and second compressors (2) for independently controlling operation thereof, the first and second compressors being configured to operate (and capable of operating) in a steady state mode of operation and a high-load mode of operation (in the instant case, controller 32 adjusts the capacity of the first and second compressors, therefore, having the capability operating said compressors in a steady state mode of operation and a high-load mode of operation); and\na sensor (refer to pressure detecting means 5) operatively coupled to the at least one controller (refer to Fig. 1), the sensor (5) being configured to sense a discharge pressure of the second refrigerant (from refrigerant being discharged from compressor 2) and to generate a signal indicative of the sensed temperature to the at least one controller (refer to Fig. 1), the at least one controller (23) being operable to switch (and having the capability of switching) operation of the first and second compressors from the steady state mode of operation to the high-load mode of operation in response to the signal.\nSpecifically in regard to the operating modes, MPEP 2114 clearly states “While features of an apparatus may be recited either structurally or functionally, claims directed to an apparatus must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure rather than function. Since the limitations in regard to the operation modes fails to further limit the apparatus in terms of structure, but rather only recite further functional limitations, the invention as taught by Sakae is deemed fully capable of performing such function.\nFurthermore, the recitations “for independently controlling operation thereof”, “to sense a discharge pressure of the second refrigerant” and “being operable to switch operation of the first and second compressors from the steady state mode of operation to the high-load mode of operation in response to the signal” have been considered recitations of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nRegarding claim 5, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claim 4. Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates (and is capable of operating) at a maximum capacity.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates at a maximum capacity” has been considered a recitation of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nRegarding claim 6, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claim 4. Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates (and is capable of operating) at less than a maximum capacity.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates at less than a maximum capacity” has been considered a recitation of intended use.

Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of one or both of the first and second compressors is increased (and is capable of increasing) from a first speed to a second speed.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of one or both of the first and second compressors is increased from a first speed to a second speed” has been considered a recitation of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nRegarding claim 9, Sakae discloses a two-stage cascade refrigeration system comprising:\na first refrigeration stage (1a) defining a first fluid circuit for circulating a first refrigerant, the first refrigeration stage having a first compressor (20), a condenser (24), and a first expansion device (26) in fluid communication with the first fluid circuit; \na second refrigeration stage (1b) defining a second fluid circuit for circulating a second refrigerant, the second refrigeration stage having a second compressor (2), a second expansion device (10), and an evaporator (6) in fluid communication with the second fluid circuit; \na heat exchanger (8) in fluid communication with the first and second fluid circuits (refer to Fig. 1) to exchange heat between the first and second refrigerants; \nwherein the first compressor (20) and the second compressor (2) are variable speed compressors (refer to the first lines of paragraphs 8 and 9, wherein both compressors are of variable capacity); \nat least one controller (32) operatively coupled to the first and second compressors (refer to Fig. 1) for independently controlling operation thereof, the first and second compressor being configured to operate (and capable of operating) in a steady state mode of operation and a high-load mode of operation (in the instant case, controller 32 adjusts the capacity of the first and second compressors, therefore, having the capability operating said compressors in a steady state mode of operation and a high-load mode of operation); and\na sensor (refer to pressure detecting means 23) operatively coupled to the at least one controller (32), the sensor (23) being configured to sense a discharge pressure of the first refrigerant (from refrigerant being discharged from compressor 2) and to generate a signal indicative of the sensed discharge pressure, to the at least one controller (refer to Fig. 1), the at least one controller (32) being operable to switch (and capable of switching) operation of the first and second compressors from the steady state mode of operation to the high-load mode of operation in response to the signal.\nSpecifically in regard to the operating modes, MPEP 2114 clearly states “While features of an apparatus may be recited either structurally or functionally, claims directed to an apparatus must be distinguished from the prior art in terms of structure rather than function. Since the limitations in regard to the operation modes fails to further limit the apparatus in terms of structure, but rather only recite further functional limitations, the invention as taught by Sakae is deemed fully capable of performing such function. \nFurthermore, the recitations “for independently controlling operation thereof”, “to operate in a steady state mode of operation and a high-load mode of operation” and “operable to switch operation of the first and second compressors from the steady state mode of operation to the high-load mode of operation in response to the signal” have been considered recitations of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nRegarding claim 10, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claim 9. Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates (and is capable of operating) at a maximum capacity.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates at a maximum capacity” has been considered a recitation of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nRegarding claim 11, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claim 9. Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates (and is capable of operating) at less than a maximum capacity.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the steady state mode of operation, one or both of the first and second compressors operates at less than a maximum capacity” has been considered a recitation of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations. \n\nRegarding claim 12, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claim 9. Further, Sakae discloses wherein, in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of one or both of the first and second compressors is increased (and is capable of increasing) from a first speed to a second speed.\nFor clarity, the recitation “in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of one or both of the first and second compressors is increased from a first speed to a second speed” has been considered a recitation of intended use. It has been held that the recitation with respect to the matter in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus satisfying the claimed structural limitations.\n\nClaim Rejections - 35 USC § 103\nThe following is a quotation of pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) which forms the basis for all obviousness rejections set forth in this Office action:\n(a) A patent may not be obtained though the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in section 102, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains. Patentability shall not be negatived by the manner in which the invention was made.\n\nClaims 8 and 13 is/are rejected under pre-AIA  35 U.S.C. 103(a) as being unpatentable over Sakae (JP 2008-008593) in view of Kuehl (US 2008/0155993).\nRegarding claims 8 and 13, Sakae meets the claim limitations as disclosed above in the rejection of claims 4 and 9. Further, Sakae discloses a fan (24a) operable to direct air across the condenser (24), but fails to explicitly disclose that said fan is a variable speed fan, wherein, in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of the fan is increased from a first speed to a second speed.\nHowever, Kuehl teaches that it is known in the art of refrigeration, to provide a cascade system including a variable speed fan (16) operable to direct air across a condenser (14).\nOne having ordinary skill in the art of refrigeration would recognize that by providing a variable speed fan, when the speed of the fan is increased it decreases the high pressure of the refrigerant at an outlet of the compressor. This results in reducing the pressure difference of the refrigerant between the inlet and outlet of the compressor, saving energy, and improving reliability.\nTherefore, it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill before the effective filing date of the claimed invention, to modify Sakae by providing a variable speed fan as taught by Kuehl, wherein, in the high-load mode of operation, a speed of the fan is increased from a first speed to a second speed, in order to save energy and improve reliability in view of the teachings by Kuehl along with the knowledge generally available to one having ordinary skill in the art of refrigeration.\n\nConclusion\n",
